# semanticLayoutCorrection
Changes I made will be given in a bulleted list below:
- the div with class="header" was changed to section
- the div tags containting the ul within the header were changed to nav tags.
- The ul was given an id, and the li elements were given a class; appropriate changes were made in the CSS document.
- The div tags with class="hero" were changed to section tags as I felt this part of the page was it's own section.
- The divs with class="benefits" and class="content" were changed to section tags.
- The children of the divs with class="benefits" were changed to article because I felt they were part of a sidebar.
- The children of the section class="content" were changed from div tags to article tags because I felt they made sense on their own and it was approriate to add a heading. 
- The div with class="footer" was changed to aside tags because I did not feel the footer was needed to understand the current content.
- I arranged the flow of index.html to match the order of the styles.css. 
- In the CSS document, I combined selectors with the same properties and values.
- I changed some of the coloring because I felt these colors were a bit softer, which I felt were easier to look at and less distracting from the content of the page, while still looking professional. 
- I also tried to organize the html document with appropriate indentation and commenting.
